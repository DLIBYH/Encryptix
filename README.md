# Encryptix Machine Learning Internship Program
## A fully functional demonstration of three machine learning tasks written in python!

This repository is an example that was built along the Kaggle website. Every part of this repository is sample code which shows how to perform the machine learning tasks assigned in the internship program.

- Task 1 : It shows how to predict genre of a movie using machine learning classifiers.
- Task 2 : It shows how to predict customer churn for a service or business subscription using machine learning algorithms.
- Task 3 : It shows how to classify the legitimacy of a SMS message using machine learning classifiers.
